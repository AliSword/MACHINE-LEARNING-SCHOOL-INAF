Neural networks

Build a mathematical function with lots of parameters to solve problems.
Neural network and loss function depend on the problem you want to deal with.
The activation function needs to be non-linear in order to have a result that
is not a linear combination of the inputs.
You increase or reduce the nymber of layers and neuron base on overfitting or 
underfitting. Test whether your model is too simple or too complex.

You can design your network in order to do what you want it does.
