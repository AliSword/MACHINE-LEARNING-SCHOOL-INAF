Convolutional NN for image recognition (Keras and Tensorflow)

Used to modify images (e.g. sharpening). You reduce the dimension. In the 
slide example the borders are important so you do convolution to extract 
them.

Poling methods: to reduce dimensionality of an image.

Padding: adding elements to the output of convolutions or pooling to get back
the original size.
Convolution in NN generates kernels.
Learn what filters (kernels) can I used to predict somenthing.
Essentially here you learn the filters instead of weights.
