# MACHINE LEARNING SCHOOL in collaboration with INAF (Istituto Nazionale Astrofisica) Milan (MLSINAF)

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning school organised in collaboration with INAF (MLSINAF). 
This repository may be updated each day during the school, according to feedback from the participants. Thus
is a good idea to clone it regularly (if you do not know how to do it check the official documentation at [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

## How to use it

The best way to use it, is to have a python distribution installed (for example [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) on your laptop or machine, then clone this repository and use it locally. In the folderes for each day, you will find power point presentations, PDF to read and (normally in a folder call ```code```) [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to try.
